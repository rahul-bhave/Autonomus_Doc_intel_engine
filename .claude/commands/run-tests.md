# Run Tests

Run the project test suite and report results.

## Steps

1. Run: `PYTHONPATH=. .venv/Scripts/pytest tests/ -v`
2. Report total passed/failed/skipped counts
3. If any tests fail, show the failure details and suggest fixes
4. If all tests pass, confirm the count (e.g., "85/85 tests passing")
